# Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (again)

---
# Setting up our studies

When we embark on a programme on research, we begin by identifying a **research question**.

- Do people who have been a victim of crime express higher fear of crime?

- Are people faster at saying the names of colours when the names are written in the same colour?

# Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) (again)

Our typical way of answering questions such as these is to set up a Null Hypothesis as an alternative. 

Typically, this hypothesis is that of **zero** effect. 

We then pose the question:

If there were no difference or relationship between these two variables in the population, how likely is it that we would observe this data in our sample?

---
# The process of NHST

```{r}
a <- rnorm(50)
b <- rnorm(50, mean = 1)
t.test(a, b)
```

# Interpreting p-values

# Significance versus non-signifiance

In our field, we typically set our significance criterion - *alpha*, or $\alpha$ - at .05.

If the p-value of our test falls **below** this threshold, we say we have a *significant* result, and we get all excited and break out the bubbly. 
`r paste(rep(emo::ji("champagne"), 3))`

If the p-value falls **above** this threshold, we say we have a *non-significant* result, and we get extremely upset.
`r  paste(emo::ji("disappointed"), emo::ji("sob"), emo::ji("disappointed"))`

(both these reactions are a little bit over-the-top)

In other words, assuming the null hypothesis is true (no difference): out of 1000s of samples, each with a distribution, mean and statistic, our sample is only one. If it is a sample with a mean and statistic in the 5% of the tails of the distribution of all samples, then our result is considered significant.

# Type I and Type II errors

Under NHST, we are trying to decide whether our statistical results match reality. There are **two** basic types of error we can make. 

|         | Null hypothesis is false| Null hypothesis is true|
|-        |   :-------------:       |  :---------------:     |
|p <= .05 |True positive            | False positive         |
|p > .05  |False negative           | True negative          |

*False positives* - a significant result when there is *no* real effect - are called **Type I errors**.

*False negatives* - a non-significant result when there *is* a real effect - are called **Type II errors**.

---
# The false-positive rate

When the null hypothesis is **true**, *any specific p-value is as likely as any other*.

So if the null hypothesis is *true*, and there is *no* real effect, we will get a **significant result** 5% of the time - **1 in every 20** repeats.

In other words, setting $\alpha$ at .05 means we accept a **false positive rate** of 5%.

# Effect sizes

*p-values* tell us how likely it was that the data we observed would happen if the null hypothesis were true. But to understand what our tests are really telling us, we need to look at *effect sizes*.

Effect sizes:

1) Communicate the practical significance of a result.

2) Enable comparison across different studies and different scales.

3) Allow you to perform *power analysis*.

# Standardized effect sizes

# Standardized mean differences

# Cohen's d

Cohen's *d* ranges from 0 to $\infty$ (infinity!)

The basic calculation is pretty simple - it's the *mean difference* divided by the *standard deviation pooled across conditions*.

$$ \frac{\mu_1 - \mu_2}{ SDpooled } $$

All variations of Cohen's *d* for different types of design (e.g. $d_z$ for within-subjects designs) are variants of this formula.

#Interpreting Cohen's d

The website linked here provides a great interactive tool to visualize what Cohen's *d* is
[RPsychologist Cohen's d](https://rpsychologist.com/d3/cohend/)

---
# Pooled standard deviation

The pooled standard deviation is calculated using this formula:

$$ SD_{pooled} = \sqrt\frac{SD^2_1 + SD^2_2}{2} $$

```{r}
sqrt((sd(a)^2 + sd(b)^2) / 2)
```

---
# Quick example

```{r}
t.test(a, b)

(mean(a) - mean(b)) / sqrt((sd(a)^2 + sd(b)^2) / 2)
```

---
# The `effectsize` package

A simpler way to calculate Cohen's *d* is to use the `cohens_d` function from the `effectsize` package.

```{r}
library(effectsize)
cohens_d(a, b)
```

This also gives us *confidence intervals* around the effect size - a helpful reminder that these are *estimates*.

# Converting from r to d

# Proportion of variance explained

For regressions, and ANOVAs, we don't use the correlation coefficient on its own. Rather, we use one of the various *proportion of variance explained* effect sizes.

|Symbol | name|
|---- |---- |
| $r^2$ | r-squared |
| $\eta^2$ | eta-squared|
| $\eta^2_p$ | partial eta-squared|
| $\eta^2_g$ | generalized eta-squared|

---
# Proportion of variance explained

Every one of these measures is a variation on the same thing: how much does the relationship between our variables reduce the error of our model.

Remember the formula for R-squared ( $r^2$)? 

$r^2 = \frac{SS_m}{SS_t}$

It's the ratio of the variance explained by the model to the total variance in the model. Thus, it's the *percentage of variance explained by the model*.

# Reporting effect sizes in your results

When reporting your statistical results, it's best practice (though not always followed...) to report both standardized **and** unstandardized effect sizes.

1) Reporting **unstandardized** effect sizes helps understand how big the effect is in *real terms*. 

2) Reporting **standardized** effect sizes helps compare the effect to effects in different studies and on different scales.

3) Always interpret the effect sizes. Take care of the difference between *statistical* and *practical* significance.

4) Many of the standardized effect sizes are somewhat *interchangeable*, but always try to report the right one for your test (e.g. Cohen's d for t-tests, $r^2$ / $adjusted-r^2$ for regression)

---
# Which standardized effect should you report?

|Statistical test| Standardized effect size|
|---||
| t-test| $d$ (between), $d_z$ (within), $d_s$|
| ANOVA | $\eta^2$ (one-way), $\eta^2_p$ (factorial), $\eta^2_g$ (Any)|
| Correlation | $r$|
| Linear (simple or multiple) regression | $r^2$, $adjusted-r^2$|

Note - not every possible test and every possible effect size can fit! We'll cover some more later in the course...

# Rules of thumb for interpreting standardized effect sizes

|Effect size|small|medium| large|
|-|-|-|-|
|d|0.2|0.5|0.8|
|r|.1|.3|.5|
| $r^2$|.1|.19|.25|
| $\eta^2$ |.01|.06|.14|
| $\eta^2_p$ |.01|.09| .25|
| $\eta^2_g$ |.02|.13|.26|

These are *guidelines*, not *rules*. (you can also try the `interpret` functions from `effectsize`)

# Designing for statistical power

# Statistical power

Statistical power is the inverse of the **false-negative rate**. 

Also termed *beta*, or $\beta$, power is the probability of getting a significant result with a given *sample size*, *statistical test*, and *effect size*. 

By convention, psychological studies aim for **80% power** - we accept a 20% false-negative rate!

# Estimating sample size

We can estimate the *required sample size* of a specific statistical test if we know the desired *power* and the *expected effect size*. The hardest part of this is typically **knowing what effect size you expect**.

```{r}
library(pwr)
pwr.t.test(power = .8, # this is a proportion
           d = .3, # Cohen's d
           type = "one.sample") # we are doing a one-sample t.test

# Why don't we aim for 100% power?

           d = .3, # Cohen's d
           type = "one.sample") # we are doing a one-sample t.test

100% power is often *just a little* impractical.

# Critiquing the statistical power of a study

A common critique of studies is that their sample size is **too low**, and thus that they lack statistical power.

But any given study always has 80% power to detect **something**: power is a **curve**.

A better critique is that a study has insufficient sample size to reliably detect a **meaningful, important effect**.
