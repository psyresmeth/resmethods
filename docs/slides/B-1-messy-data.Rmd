Tables of data are what you're most commonly dealing with in R.

This one conforms to the **tidy data** principles:

One row per observation, one column per variable

# Different types of file

The most common file formats you'll deal with are either Excel files or text files, but you may also find dealing with SPSS files useful.

Fortunately, R has several functions and packages for importing data!

|File formats| File extension| Functions| Package|
|-|-|-|-|
|SPSS  | .sav| `read_sav()`| library(haven)|
|Excel | .xls, .xlsx|`read_excel()`|library(readxl)|
|Text  | .csv, .txt, .* |`read_csv()`, `read_delim()`|library(readr)|

Plottting data is really important for all aspects of data analysis.

The `ggplot2` package provides a framework for doing this:
```{r dens-plot, fig.show = "hide", fig.height=5}
ggplot(example_rt_df,
       aes(x = RT, fill = Block)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_bw()

Two out of the 200 pairs of x-y values were replaced.

# What should we do with outliers?

Three common approaches:

1. **Remove them**
    
    - If you're sure these reflect an error, not genuine data, then removal is a possibility. 

--
2. **Transformation**
    
    - *rescaling* or *transforming* your data may help reduce the influence of outliers. (We'll come back to this!)

--
3. **Replace them**
    
    - Replacing the outliers with values $\pm$ 2-3 standard deviations away from the mean.

# Identifying outliers

Sometimes a *threshold* is used to determine whether an observation is an outlier.

Sometimes this is driven by common sense: e.g. a value of 120 for a participant's age is **extremely** unlikely to be genuine.

Sometimes this is *data-driven*: e.g. values more than $\pm$ 3 standard deviations away from the mean are *unusual*.

Confusingly, Missing At Random (MAR) data is not missing (completely) at random. 

For example, for some reason, people older than 21 typically failed to complete the third questionnaire.

This data is MAR - whether the data in the third column is missing is related to the value of the fourth column.

# Missing Not At Random

The final, most troubling type of missing data is data that is Missing Not At Random (MNAR).

For example, imagine that the questionnaire relates to depression; people who score high for depression are less likely to complete the final questionnaire.

In this case, the values that are missing for the third questionnaire depends on the value of the responses to that questionnaire, so this data is MNAR.

# Dealing with missing data

.pull-left[
List-wise deletion: Cases with missing data are completely **removed** from **all** analysis.

Pair-wise deletion: Cases with missing data are only **removed** from **comparisons where one or more variables are missing**.

By default, functions such as `mean()` return NA if any value in the input is NA/missing.

```{r}
mean(temp_df_missing$X1)
mean(temp_df_missing$X1, na.rm = TRUE)
sum(complete.cases(temp_df_missing))

# Single Imputation

Replace missing values with a simple "best-guess". e.g. Using the mean or the median for the condition.

.pull-left[
```{r}
orig_data <- 1:12
orig_data
mean(orig_data)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
missing_one <- orig_data
missing_one[6] <- NA
missing_one
mean(missing_one,  na.rm = TRUE)
```

Problem: the mean and median are biased by the missing data. And replacing a missing value with one of these values tends to artificially reduce variability.

## Multiple Imputation

In **multiple** imputation, we replace missing values with estimates based on a *model* of the data that incorporates uncertainty about what the value should be. 

We create a model based on the data that is not missing, and use its predictions to guess the values that the missing data has.

We do this multiple times and then take an average or *pool* the results to fill in the gap.

Packages such as `mice` and `Amelia` can do this for us, and help us identify patterns of missingness.

# Alternative approaches to missing data, skew, and other oddities

Generalized Linear Models (as opposed to General Linear Models) allow modelling of data of many different types without necessitating transformations. 

For example, counts can be modelled using Poisson regression, and categorical outcomes can be modelled with logistic regression.

*Multilevel* or *mixed*-models can handle all of these things and much more besides; they are perfectly capable of handling missing data.

We'll cover both logistic regression and multilevel models later in the course!

# Real-life example

Data collected as part of a Newfoundland Symphony Orchestra Concert to study memory for new music as a function of age and familiarity (tonal/atonal, familiar, unfamiliar).

1. Clicker data
2. Questionnaire (contains age information)
3. Cognitive tests

How would you address the missing data?

Look into power and effect sizes:

    - effect sizes (2.6.4)
    - statistical power (2.6.5)
