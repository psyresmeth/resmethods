# Mediation and moderation

In linear regression, we're looking to understand the relationship between 
*predictors* and *outcomes*.

# Moderation 

Moderation is when the strength of the relationship between two variables depends on a third variable.

# The *epi.bfi* dataset

The `epi.bfi` dataset from the `psychTools` package

```{r}
head(epi.bfi)
```

---
# Simple linear regression

Let's model `bdi` (Beck Depression Inventory) as a function of `stateanx` (State Anxiety)

```{r}
st_bdi <- lm(bdi ~ stateanx, data = epi.bfi)
summary(st_bdi)
```

---
# Multiple linear regression

An additional predictor that we may find interesting is `epiNeur` - a measure of *neuroticism* from the *Eysenck Personality Inventory*. 

```{r}
st_neu <- lm(bdi ~ stateanx + epiNeur, data = epi.bfi)
summary(st_neu)
```

---
# Adding interaction terms

What if the effect of `stateanx` depends on the level of `epiNeur`? For example, people who score high on *neuroticism* might be more affected by *state anxiety* than people who are low on *neuroticism*. 

We add an interaction to our model using `:` between the two variables:

```{r}
int_model <- lm(bdi ~ stateanx + epiNeur + stateanx:epiNeur,
                data = epi.bfi)
```

We can also use `*` instead of `+`. Thus, `stateanx * epiNeur` will give us the main effect of `stateanx`, the main effect of `epiNeur`, and the interaction between the two.

---
# Moderation

.pull-left[
```{r echo = FALSE}
statisticalDiagram(1)
```
]
.pull-right[
An interaction like this has *three* terms. 

There is a term for each of the main effects.

There is also a term for the interaction, which is the *product* of the two main effects.

```{r highlight.output=14}
summary(int_model)

# Interpreting the coefficients

```{r}
coef(int_model)
```

The coefficients tell you what the effect of a 1 unit increase in the variable has on the dependent variable.

But the coefficients of the main effects (`stateanx` and `epiNeur`) are hard to interpret *in the presence of an interaction* unless the variables have been **centred**. 

---
# Interpreting the coefficients

```{r}
coef(int_model)
```

When the predictors are uncentred, these coefficients tell us (*take a deep breath*) 

- the effect of a 1 unit increase in `stateanx` when `epiNeur` is 0 
- the effect of a 1 unit increase in `epiNeur` when `stateanx` is 0 
- the difference between the effect of a 1 unit increase in `stateanx` when `epiNeur` is 0 and the increase in `stateanx` when `epiNeur` is 1, and the difference between the effect of a 1 unit the increase in `epiNeur` when `stateanx` is 0 and the increase in `epiNeur` when `stateanx` is 1

(or something like that)

---
# Mean-centring

We can use the `scale()` function to perform mean-centring, standardization, or both.

```{r}
cent_model <- lm(bdi ~ scale(stateanx, scale = FALSE) * scale(epiNeur, scale = FALSE), 
                 data = epi.bfi)
coef(cent_model)
```
```{r}
coef(st_neu)
```

---

```{r}
tab_model(st_neu, int_model)
```
---
# Simple slopes

.pull-left[
The `interact_plot()` function from the `interactions` package provides a nice way to visualize the interaction.

We look at the steepness of the slope at different levels of one of the variables.

```{r simp-slope, fig.height=5, fig.show = "hide"}
interact_plot(int_model,
              pred = stateanx,
              modx = epiNeur)
```
]
.pull-right[
![](`r knitr::fig_chunk("simp-slope", "png")`)
]

---
# Simple slopes

.pull-left[
We can also add individual data points using `plot.points = TRUE`.

Confidence intervals can be added using `interval = TRUE`.

```{r simp-points, fig.height=5, fig.show = "hide"}
interact_plot(int_model,
              pred = stateanx,
              modx = epiNeur,
              plot.points = TRUE,
              interval = TRUE)
```
]
.pull-right[
![](`r knitr::fig_chunk("simp-points", "png")`)
]


---
# Simple slopes

The interaction means that the *slope* of the effect of `stateanx` differs at different values of `epiNeur`.

We can use the `sim_slopes()` function from `interactions` to statistically explore how `stateanx` varies as a function of `epiNeur`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
sim_slopes(int_model,
           pred = stateanx,
           modx = epiNeur,
           johnson_neyman = FALSE)
```

---

```{r echo = FALSE}
sim_slopes(int_model,
           pred = stateanx,
           modx = epiNeur,
           johnson_neyman = FALSE)
```

The slope of `stateanx` *increases* as `epiNeur` increases.

---
# Johnson-Neyman plots

```{r fig.height=4, fig.width = 6, message = FALSE, fig.show = "hide"}
johnson_neyman(int_model, pred = stateanx, modx = epiNeur)

# Mediation

# Mediation

Mediation refers to a situation in which the effect of a predictor is transmitted *through* another variable.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hide"}
pmacroModel(4,
            radx = .1)
```
.center[
![](images/mediation_model.png)
]

---
# Mediation

In this example, *room temperature* predicts the *amount that people drink*; specifically, we'd expect that higher temperatures would increase drinking.

.center[
```{r echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hide"}
openplotmat(asp = 1)
textrect(c(.1, .5), radx = .15, lab = "Room temp")
textrect(c(.9, .5), radx = .15, lab = "Amount drunk")
straightarrow(c(.25, .5), c(.75, .5))
```
![](images/temp_drunk.png)
]

---
# Mediation

Nevertheless, it's possible that higher temperatures increase drinking *indirectly*: higher temperatures make people feel more *thirsty*, which in turn makes them *drink more*.

.center[
```{r echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hide"}
pmacroModel(4,
            labels = list(X = "Room temp",
                          Mi = "Thirst",
                          Y = "Amount drunk"),
            radx = .1)

# The `estress` data

```{r echo = FALSE}
head(estress, 5)
```

---
# Path *c* - the *total* effect

This is the effect of the IV on the DV.

```{r highlight.output = 12}
path_c <- lm(withdraw ~ estress, data = estress)
summary(path_c)
```

---
# Path *a* 

This is the effect of the IV on the Mediator.

```{r highlight.output = 12}
path_a <- lm(affect ~ estress, data = estress)
summary(path_a)
```

---
# Path *b* 

This is the effect of the mediator on the DV, controlling for the IV.

```{r highlight.output = 12}
path_b <- lm(withdraw ~ affect, data = estress)
summary(path_b)
```

---
# Path *c'* - the direct effect

This checks whether the IV predicts the DV after controlling for the mediator. 

```{r highlight.output = 13}
path_c_dir <- lm(withdraw ~ affect + estress, data = estress)
summary(path_c_dir)
```

---
# Is there mediation?

Now that we've fit all these models, how do we work out if there is *mediation*?

Does the effect of `estress` differ after controlling for `affect`?

```{r}
tab_model(path_c, path_c_dir)
```

---
# Is there mediation?

We need to calculate the *indirect* effect. There are two ways to do that.

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Difference method]
```{r}
coef(path_c)["estress"] - coef(path_c_dir)["estress"]
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Product method]
```{r}
coef(path_a)["estress"] * coef(path_c_dir)["affect"]
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Which one to use?]
.center[
![:scale 60%](images/spidey.jpg)
]
]
]

---
# Is there a mediation?

```{r}
 coef(path_c)["estress"] - coef(path_c_dir)["estress"]
```

Calculating the indirect effect is simple enough - it looks like there is some effect of `estress` transmitted, so we may well have mediation.

But we still need to test if this is *significant*.

 - The Sobel test (don't use this)
 - Bootstrapping (use this)
 
---
# Bootstrapping

Bootstrapping is a non-parametric resampling method.

The data is *resampled with replacement* many times over, and the test statistic is calculated each time. 

For mediation, the statistic that's calculated each time is the *indirect effect*.

This creates a *distribution* of possible values for the test statistic, from which we can calculate *confidence intervals*.

(this is what the PROCESS macro in SPSS does)

---
# Mediation model 

We can use the `mediate()` function from the `psych` package to add a mediating variable. **Importantly,** we place `()` around the mediator.

.pull-left[
```{r fig.show = "hide"}
medi_model <- mediate(withdraw ~ estress + (affect),
                      data = estress)
```
![](images/temp_medi_out.png)
]
.pull-right[
We can use the difference between $c'$ and $c$ as the *indirect* effect, so the *indirect effect* of `estress` is around **.14**.

When `estress` increases by 1, `affect` increases by .17; and when `affect` increases by 1, `withdraw` increases by .77.

So `estress` is increasing `affect` which is increasing `withdraw`.

# Multiple mediation

```{r multimed, fig.show = "hide"}
multi_medi <- mediate(withdraw ~ estress + (affect) + (tenure),
                      data = estress)
```
.pull-left[
![](`r knitr::fig_chunk("multimed", "png")`)
]
.pull-right[
It's also possible to have multiple mediators! 

Simply add additional predictors surrounded by brackets. 

In this one, all the mediation is via `affect` - `tenure` doesn't influence `withdraw`.
]

---
# Moderated mediation

It's also possible to do *moderated mediation*. Simply include interaction terms for moderators. Have fun interpreting these `r emo::ji("smiling face with horns")`

```{r fig.align = "center", fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4.5, fig.asp = NULL}
mod_medi <- mediate(withdraw ~ estress + affect*sex + (affect),
                    data = estress)
```
