WHERE A LIMITATION OF\r\nLIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT\r\nAPPLY TO YOU.\r\nThe disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\r\nabove shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible,\r\nmost closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all\r\nliability.\r\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\r\nThis Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\r\nSimilar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this\r\nPublic License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate\r\nautomatically.\r\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated\r\nunder Section 6(a), it reinstates:\r\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it\r\nis cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\r\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\r\nright the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this\r\nPublic License.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\r\nLicensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\r\ndistributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will\r\nnot terminate this Public License.\r\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\r\nLicense.\r\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\r\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\r\nterms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly\r\nagreed.\r\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\r\nLicensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of\r\nthe terms and conditions of this Public License.\r\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\r\nshall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\r\nconditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be\r\nmade without permission under this Public License.\r\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License\r\nis deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\r\nminimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot\r\nbe reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without\r\naffecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\r\nconditions.\r\nNo term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\r\nfailure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\r\nLicensor.\r\nNothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\r\nas a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that\r\napply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any\r\njurisdiction or authority.\r\n=======================================================================\r\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.\r\nNotwithstanding, Creative Commons may elect to apply one of its public\r\nlicenses to material it publishes and in those instances will be\r\nconsidered the “Licensor.” The text of the Creative Commons public\r\nlicenses is dedicated to the public domain under the CC0 Public Domain\r\nDedication.
