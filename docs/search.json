However, if You fail to comply with\r\nthis Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\r\nterminate automatically.\r\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\r\nSection 6(a), it reinstates:\r\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\r\nit is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\r\nviolation; or\r\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\r\nright the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\r\nof this Public License.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\r\nLicensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\r\ndistributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\r\nwill not terminate this Public License.\r\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\r\nLicense.\r\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\r\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\r\nterms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\r\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\r\nLicensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\r\nindependent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\r\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\r\nshall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\r\nconditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\r\nbe made without permission under this Public License.\r\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\r\ndeemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\r\nminimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.
